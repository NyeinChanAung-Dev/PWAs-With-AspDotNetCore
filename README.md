# PWAs-With-AspDotNetCore
- PWAs with asp.net core mvc 3.1
- Starter Progress Web Apps using asp.net core mvc 3.1.

# What you'll build
In this project you're going to build a web app using PWA techniques. Your app will:

1. Use **responsive design**, so it works on desktop or mobile.
2. Be fast, using a **service worker to precache the app resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run and to cache the some data at runtime to improve performance.**
3. Be installable, using a **web app manifest and the beforeinstallprompt** event to notify the user it's installable.
