# PWAs-With-AspDotNetCore
- PWAs with asp.net core mvc 3.1
- Starter Progress Web Apps using asp.net core mvc 3.1.

# What you'll build
In this codelab, you're going to build a weather web app using PWA techniques. Your app will:

1). Use responsive design, so it works on desktop or mobile.
2). Be fast, using a service worker to precache the app resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run and to cache the weather data at runtime to improve performance.
3). Be installable, using a web app manifest and the beforeinstallprompt event to notify the user it's installable.
