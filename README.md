# What you'll build
In this codelab, you're going to build a weather web app using PWA techniques. Your app will:

Use responsive design, so it works on desktop or mobile.
Be fast, using a service worker to precache the app resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) needed to run and to cache the weather data at runtime to improve performance.
Be installable, using a web app manifest and the beforeinstallprompt event to notify the user it's installable.
